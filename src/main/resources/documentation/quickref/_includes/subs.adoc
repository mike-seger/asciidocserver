Text substitution elements replace characters, markup, attribute references, and macros with converter specific styles and values.
When Asciidoctor processes a document it uses a set of six text substitution elements.
The processor runs the text substitution elements in the following order.

. Special characters
. Quotes
. Attribute references
. Replacements
. Inline macros
. Post replacements

In turn, these substitutions are organized into composite value groups.
The table below shows which substitution elements are included in each group.

include::subs-group-table.adoc[]

By default, the `normal` substitution group is applied to most block and inline elements.
However, there are a few exceptions.

The `header` substitution group is applied to metadata lines (author and revision information) in the document header.
This group is also applied to the values of attribute entries, regardless of whether those entries are defined in the header or elsewhere in the document.
In the header, only special characters and attribute references are replaced.
In attribute entries, you can also use the <<user-manual#pass-macros,inline pass macro>>.

Fenced, literal, listing, and source blocks are processed with the `verbatim` substitution group.
Only special characters are replaced in these blocks.

The `pass` substitution group can only be applied to passthrough elements.
Attribute references and macros are replaced in passthroughs.

The `none` substitution group is applied to comment blocks.

.The title substitution group
****
The `title` substitution group includes the same text substitutions as the normal group.
However, the order that the substitutions are executed is slightly different.
Text substitutions are applied to titles in the following sequence:

. Special characters
. Quotes
. Replacements
. Inline macros
. Attribute references
. Post replacements
