== Using the Ruby API

This document is included in convert-documents and the user-manual.
TODO: expand this section

Asciidoctor also includes a Ruby API that lets you generate an HTML document directly from a Ruby application.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'asciidoctor'

Asciidoctor.convert_file 'mysample.adoc'
----

Alternatively, you can capture the HTML output in a variable instead of writing it to a file.

[source,ruby]
----
html = Asciidoctor.convert_file 'mysample.adoc', to_file: false, header_footer: true
puts html
----

The convert methods also accept a map of options.
Use of this map is described in <<user-manual.adoc#ruby-api-options,Ruby API Options>>.
