Asciidoctor provides built-in roles to align the text of a paragraph.
The name of the role follows the pattern `text-<alignment>`, where `<alignment>` is one of left, center, right, or justify (e.g., `text-center`).

Here's an example of a paragraph with center-aligned text.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.text-center]
This text is centered.
----

These built-in text alignment roles are currently supported by the HTML5 and PDF converters.
