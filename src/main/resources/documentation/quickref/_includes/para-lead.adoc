Apply the `lead` style to any paragraph, and it will render using a larger font size.
The lead style is assigned to the <<user-manual#role,role attribute>>.
You can set `role` using the long- or shorthand method.

When you convert a document to HTML using the default stylesheet, the first paragraph of the preamble is automatically styled as a lead paragraph.
To disable this behavior, assign any role to the first paragraph.

The presence of the custom role tells the CSS not to style it as a lead paragraph.
