To parse a file into an `Asciidoctor::Document` object:

[source,ruby]
doc = Asciidoctor.load_file 'mysample.adoc'

You can get information about the document:

[source,ruby]
puts doc.doctitle
puts doc.attributes

More than likely, you will want to convert the document.
To convert a file containing AsciiDoc markup to HTML 5, use:

[source,ruby]
Asciidoctor.convert_file 'mysample.adoc'

The command will output to the file [.path]_mysample.html_ in the same directory.

You can convert the file to DocBook 5.0 by setting the `:backend` option to `'docbook'`:

[source,ruby]
Asciidoctor.convert_file 'mysample.adoc', backend: 'docbook'

The command will output to the file [.path]_mysample.xml_ in the same directory.
If you're on Linux, you can view the file using {uri-yelp}[Yelp].
