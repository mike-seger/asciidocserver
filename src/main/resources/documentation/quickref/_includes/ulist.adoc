If you were to create a list in an e-mail, how would you do it?
Chances are, you'd mark list items using the same characters that Asciidoctor uses to find list items.

In the example below, each list item is marked using an asterisk (`{asterisk}`), the AsciiDoc syntax specifying an unordered list item.

A list item's first line of text must be offset from the marker (`{asterisk}`) by at least one space.
If you prefer, you can indent list items.
Blank lines are required before and after a list.
Additionally, blank lines are permitted, but not required, between list items.

You can add a title to a list by prefixing the title with a period (`.`).

Was your instinct to use a hyphen (`-`) instead of an asterisk to mark list items?
Guess what?
That works too!

You should reserve the hyphen for lists that only have a single level because the hyphen marker (`-`) doesn't work for nested lists.
Now that we've mentioned nested lists, let's go to the next section and learn how to create lists with multiple levels.

.Separating Lists
****
If you have adjacent lists, they have the tendency to want to fuse together.
To force lists apart, insert a line comment (`//`) surrounded by blank lines between the two lists.
Here's an example, where the `-` text in the line comment indicates the line serves as an "`end of list`" marker:
