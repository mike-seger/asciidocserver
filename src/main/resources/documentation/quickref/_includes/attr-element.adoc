// tag::intro[]
An attribute list can apply to blocks, inline quotes text, and macros.
The attributes and their values contained in the list will take precedence over attribute entries.

.Anatomy of an attribute list
 [positional_attribute1,positional_attribute2,name_attribute1="value"]

Attribute lists:

. apply to blocks as well as macros and inline quoted text
. can contain positional and named attributes
. take precedence over global attributes
// end::intro[]

==== Positional attribute
// tag::pos[]
Positional attributes are un-named values at the start of the attribute list.
The attribute that they are assigned to depends on the type of the element:

* `icon:` (1) size
* `image:` and `image::` (1) alt text, (2) width, (3) height
* Delimited blocks: (1) block name (aka style)
* Other inline quoted text: (1) role

For example, the following two image macros are equivalent.

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset,300,400]

image::sunset.jpg[alt=Sunset,width=300,height=400]
----

The second macro is just a duplicate of the first macro written out longhand.
// end::pos[]

==== Named attribute
// tag::name[]
A named attribute consists of a name and a value separated by an `=` character (e.g., `name=value`).

If the value contains a space, comma, or quote character, it must be enclosed in double or single quotes (e.g., `name="value with space"`).
In all other cases, the surrounding quotes are optional.
If present, the enclosing quotes are dropped from the parsed value.

To undefine a named attribute, set the value to `None` (case sensitive).
// end::name[]

==== Attribute List Substitutions
// tag::subs[]
Attribute references are expanded before the block attribute list is processed.
Therefore, it's not necessary to force substitutions to be applied if you simply want to use a document attribute reference in a block attribute.

If the attribute name (for a positional attribute) or value (for a named attribute) is enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `+title='Processed by https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]'+`), <<subs,normal substitutions>> are applied to the value at assignment time (with some exceptions).
This is also true for positional attributes, such as the attribution for a quote block.
No special processing is performed, except for attribute reference expansion, if the value is not enclosed in quotes or is enclosed in double quotes.

If the attribute value contains the same quote character being used to enclose the value, escape the quote character in the value by prefixing it with a backslash (e.g., `title="\"Dark Horse\" is a song by George Harrison"`).
