The document header is a special set of contiguous lines at the start of the document that encapsulates the document title, author and revision information, and document attributes (either built-in or user-defined), all optional.

[.lead]
*The document header must _not_ contain any blank lines or block content!*

The header typically begins with a document title (i.e., level-0 section title), though this element is optional.
If a document title is specified, it may be immediately followed by two optional lines with a predefined format that define the author and revision information.
Finally, the header may declare document attributes (built-in or user-defined) using attribute entries.

Since the document title is *optional*, it's possible for the header to only consist of attribute entries.
No other section level (e.g., a level-1 section title) can define the document header.

Document attribute entries may be placed anywhere in the header, including above the document title.
However, the preferred style is to place them immediately below the document title, author line, and revision line, if present.
Where these attribute entries *cannot* be placed is after a blank line or below a level-1 section title since that falls outside the document header.

The first block content (e.g., a paragraph, a delimited block, a level-1 section title, etc) or a blank line in the document marks the end of the header.
Line comments may be used in the header, but only if those lines are directly adjacent to other lines in the header.
Any attributes defined below the document header will be scoped to the document, but _not_ the document header.

The header is _optional_ when the `doctype` is `article` or `book`.
However, a header is required when the document type is `manpage`.
The requirements for a manual page (man page) are described in the <<user-manual#man-pages,man pages>> section.

The header (document title, author, and revision information) is included by default when converting to a standalone document.
//This means that the header of a document called via an <<user-manual#include-directive,include directive>> will be processed and converted.
If you do not want the header of a document to be displayed, set the `noheader` attribute in the document's header (or set the attribute using the API or CLI).

.Front matter
****
Many static site generators, such as Jekyll and Middleman, rely on front matter added to the top of the document to determine how to convert the content.
Asciidoctor has a number of attributes available to correctly handle front matter.
See the <<user-manual#static-website-generators,static website generators>> section to learn how Asciidoctor integrates with static website generators.

Now let's explore the document title in detail.
