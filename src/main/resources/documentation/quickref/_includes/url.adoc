A Uniform Resource Link (URL) represents the location of a resource on the web.
Typical URLs contain a scheme, domain name, file name, and extension.

// tag::basic[]
Asciidoctor recognizes the following common schemes without the help of any markup.

[#schemes]
* http
* https
* ftp
* irc
* mailto
* \email@email.com

You can think of these like implicit macro names (the bare email address being a special case).
Since the URL in the example below begins with a protocol (in this case _https_ followed by a colon), Asciidoctor will automatically turn it into a hyperlink when it is processed.

include::ex-url.adoc[tag=base-co]
----
<1> The trailing period will not get caught up in the link.

To prevent automatic linking of an URL, prepend it with a backslash (`\`).

[source]
----
Once launched, the site will be available at \https://example.org.
----

If you prefer URLs to be shown with the scheme hidden, set the `hide-uri-scheme` attribute in the document's header.

[source]
----
:hide-uri-scheme:

https://asciidoctor.org
----

When the hide-uri-scheme attribute is set, the above URL will render as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<a href="https://asciidoctor.org">asciidoctor.org</a>
----

Note the absence of _https_ inside the `<a>` element.

To attach a URL to text, enclose the text in square brackets at the end of the URL, thus making it an URL macro:

[source]
----
include::ex-url.adoc[tag=irc]
----
// end::basic[]

Additionally, you can format the linked text.

You may also want to append empty square brackets to force the URL to be parsed when it would not normally be recognized, such as if it's enclosed in double quotes:

[source]
----
Type "https://asciidoctor.org[]" into the location bar of your browser.
----

// tag::link[]
When a URL does not start with one of the <<schemes,common schemes>>, or the URL is not surrounded by word boundaries, you must use the `link` macro.
The `link` macro is a stronger version of a URI macro, which you can think of like an unconstrained macro.
The URL is preceded by `link:` and followed by square brackets.
The square brackets may include optional link text.
The URL is used for the text of the link if link text is not specified.
Prior to 1.5.7, if the `linkattrs` document attribute is set, the text in square brackets is parsed as attributes, which allows a window name or role to be specified.
Since 1.5.7, attributes are parsed automatically if an equal sign is found after a comma (e.g., `[link text,window=_blank]`).

Let's consider a case where we need to use the link macro (instead of just a URI macro) to expand a link when it's not adjacent to a word boundary (i.e., unconstrained).

If we didn't use the `link:` prefix in this case, the URL macro would not be detected by the parser.
// end::link[]

A URL may not display correctly when it contains characters such as underscores (`_`) or carets (`{caret}`).

Next, we'll add a target and role to a link macro.

// tag::attr[]
[#link-macro-attributes]
Prior to 1.5.7, Asciidoctor _does not_ parse attributes in the link macro by default.
If you want attributes in the link macro to be parsed, you must set the `linkattrs` document attribute in the header.
Since 1.5.7, this parsing is automatic (and the attribute is not required) if an equal sign is found after a comma.
When attribute parsing is enabled, you can then specify the name of the target window using the `window` attribute.

include::ex-url.adoc[tag=linkattrs]

Since `_blank` is the most common window name, we've introduced shorthand for it.
Just end the link text with a caret (`+^+`):

[source]
----
include::ex-url.adoc[tag=linkattrs-s]
----

CAUTION: If you use the caret syntax more than once in a single paragraph, you may need to escape the first occurrence with a backslash.

When attribute parsing is enabled, you can add a role (i.e., CSS class) to the link.

TIP: Links with attributes (including the subject and body segments on mailto links) are a feature unique to Asciidoctor.
When they're enabled, you must surround the link text in double quotes if it contains a comma.
// end::attr[]
