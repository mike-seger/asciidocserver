Since adjacent lines of text are combined into a single paragraph when Asciidoctor converts a document, that means you can wrap paragraph text or put each sentence or phrase on a separate line.
The line breaks won't appear in the output.

However, if you want the line breaks in a paragraph to be preserved, you can either use a space followed by a plus sign (`{plus}`) or set the `hardbreaks` option on the paragraph.
This results in a visible line break (e.g., `<br>`) following each line.

To preserve line breaks throughout your whole document, add the `hardbreaks` attribute to the document's header.

You can also preserve line breaks using <<user-manual#literal-text-and-blocks,literal blocks>>, <<user-manual#listing-blocks,listing blocks>>, and <<user-manual#verse,verses>>.
