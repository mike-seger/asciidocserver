- user-manual: text formatting: Bold and italic
////

The two most common ways of emphasizing a word is to format it as bold or italic.

To apply bold styling to a word or phrase, place an asterisk (`+*+`) at the beginning and end of the text you wish to format.
To bold one or more letters within a string of text, place two asterisks (`{asterisk}{asterisk}`) before and after the letter(s).

Similarly, words and characters within a word are italicized using one (`+_+`) or two (`+__+`) underscores, respectively.
When you want to bold and italicize text, the bold markup must be the outermost markup.
