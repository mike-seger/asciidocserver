{highlightjs-org}[Highlight.js] is a popular client-side syntax highlighter that supports a broad range of {highlightjs-lang}[languages].

To use highlight.js, simply add the following attribute entry to the header of your AsciiDoc file:

[source]
----
:source-highlighter: highlightjs
----

By default, Asciidoctor will link to the highlight.js library and stylesheet hosted on https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js[cdnjs] (currently version 9.15.10).
The version of the highlight.js library Asciidoctor loads from the CDN only includes support for languages in the common language bundle (apache, bash, coffeescript, cpp, cs, css, diff, http, ini, java, javascript, json, makefile, markdown, nginx, objectivec, perl, php, properties, python, ruby, shell, sql, xml, and yaml).

To load additional languages supported by highlight.js, list them in the value of the `highlightjs-languages` document attribute (separated by commas):

[source]
----
:source-highlighter: highlightjs
:highlightjs-languages: rust, swift
----

If you'd rather use a personal copy of highlight.js instead of the one hosted on the CDN, follow these steps:

. Create your custom bundle on the {highlightjs-lang}[download page].
. Download and unpack the zip into a folder called [.path]_highlight_ adjacent to your AsciiDoc file (or in the output directory, if different)
. Rename [.path]_highlight/highlight.pack.js_ to [.path]_highlight/highlight.min.js_
. Rename [.path]_highlight/styles/github.css_ to [.path]_highlight/styles/github.min.css_
** Replace `github` with the name of the `highlightjs-theme` you are using, if different.
. Add the attribute entry `:highlightjsdir: highlight` to the header of your AsciiDoc file.
** Alternatively, you can pass the `-a highlightjsdir=highlight` flag when invoking the Asciidoctor CLI.

The output file will use your personal copy of the highlight.js library and stylesheet instead of the one hosted on cdnjs.
